# learning-sql-programming

These are the Exercise Files for the LinkedIn Learning course [_Learning SQL Programming_](http://bit.ly/learnsql-github).

## Using these files

The _Learning SQL Programming_ course uses [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org) and a few additional files. These files can be found in this repository.
* *results.db* is the file to use within DB Browser for SQLite.
* *quizresults.sql* is a SQL file suitable for importing into other DBMS tools, but will not work with DB Browser for SQLite.
* *statements.sql* is a listing of each SQL statement used in the course, provided so you can check your work as you follow the course.
